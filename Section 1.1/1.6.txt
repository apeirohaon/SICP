The program will get stuck in an infinite loop.
This is because new-if is not a special form but a regular compound procedure.
This means it will use the typical applicative evaluating process.
As a result the third operand, the argument for else-clause, will also be evaluated always.
Because it calls itself and has no way of stopping it will infinitely loop.
